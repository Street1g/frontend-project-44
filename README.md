### Project "Brain games"

"Brain-games is a set of five console games based on the popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to go through it all over again. Games:

- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated.
- Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- Finding an even number.
- Determining the greatest common divisor.
- Finding a prime number.
